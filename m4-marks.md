# Marking Guide    / 40

# Interim Marks 18/25

# Product Requirements 3/5 
This is about meeting the requirements identified in the problem statement. 

- there was no way to add ingredients or items

# Product Quality 4/5
This is about the content of the pitch.

- nice UI
- date handling was weird - use HTML date field
- the calendar approach was not ideal

# Technical Briefing 8/10
This is about the content of the technical portion of the pitch. Every team member should expect to be asked about the technical details of the project. Sample question: "how is this controller wired to this view".

- while one of you (Ben) explained the architecture, others seemed less clear.
- there was a lot of Not Invented Here syndrome

# Presentation "Pitch" Marks 3/5
This is about the professionalism and presentation of your pitch and tech brief.

- don't pretend a feature is there
- pretty organized and prepared. 
- no need for BS and fancy talk. 

# Code and Design Quality /15
Note that you have until Friday before the code quality gets marked. NB: Many of the items here can be 'tested' with BetterCodeHub. In other words, a low BCH score will be a negative signal for me about this aspect.

- clarity and maintainability of the code (organization, packaging, class size)
- documentation is useful and present throughout
- code has unit tests
- code shows evidence of design principles such as SOLID, Design Patterns used where appropriate
- language and frameworks chosen are used properly (e.g. following Python idioms like list comprehensions)
- no obvious design smells like God Class, lack of refactoring, helpful names

# Bonus 12.5/12.5 (project: 5%)
- Travis CI, Junit, Docker, etc are used in meaningful way (integral part of development process)
